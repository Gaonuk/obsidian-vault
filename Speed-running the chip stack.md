I was challenged to make a chip from scratch in <2 weeks with no prior experience

**Here’s how I’m planning to speed run the entire learning process for chip design & fabrication** (suggestions welcome) 

1. Prerequisites 
	1. Review circuits physics - (semiconductors, p-n, junctions, diodes, capacitors) 
	2. Review computer systems - (transistors, gates, combinatorial logic, sequential logic, memory, ALU, CPU & Von Neumann architecture, machine language, assembly, C) 
2. **Chip Fabrication** - How are chips actually manufactured? 
	1. Read Microchip Fabrication (Peter Van Zant) 
	2. Test: Rewatch [@szeloof](https://twitter.com/szeloof)'s chip fabrication videos, everything should make sense and should be able to explain it back 
	3. Understand the progression of ASML machines 
	4. Understand how EUV works in-depth 
3. **Architectures** - What are the main chip designs used in chips today?
	1. Learn about x86 vs. ARM vs. RISC-V
	2. Learn RISC-V in-depth (chip tape-out will be using RISC-V CPU) 
4. **Electronic Design Automation** - How do you design and verify your own chips to be sent for fabrication? 
	1. Do [@matthewvenn](https://twitter.com/matthewvenn)'s zerotoasiccourse[.]com (learn chip design, verification, etc.) 
	2. Design & test my own RISC-V ASIC with Verilog/OpenLANE/Caravel - right now I'm thinking of making either a minimal GPU or transformer accelerator, but open to any ideas 
	3. Submit chip design for tape-out to TinyTapeout 
5. **ASICs** - What application specific chips are used for in different industries? How do they work? 
	1. AI Accelerators - Untether, Tenstorrent, Etched, Groq 
	2. Telecomm - Network switches, routers, NICs, etc. 
	3. Cars - engine control units (ECU), advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), etc. 
	4. Finance - FPGAs for high-frequency trading 
6. **Technology Progressions** - *How has the technology in the chip industry progressed over the past few decades*? 
	1. Progression of advancements that led to Moore's Law 
	2. Progression of advancements in NVIDIA GPUs 
	3. Progression of advancements in TSMC fabrication process 
7. Industry & Business - What are the dominant forces shaping the chip industry today? 
	1. Read Chip War 
	2. Understand the CHIPS act and geo-politics
	3. Understand the business of each part of the chip industry value chain (IP cores, EDA, wafer fab equipment, fabless chip cos, integrated device manufacturers, chip foundries, OSAT) 
8. Opportunities - What are the big opportunities in this space? 
	1. What are the big opportunities for large companies? 
	2. What are the big areas of opportunity suitable for young founders? 
	3. Where are the big VC bets going to be? 
	4. What companies are still good investments?
