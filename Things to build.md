#### Idea 1: Figma playground for Crypto AI Agents
crypto wallets that can automatically perform different tasks, maybe used to power strategies, to power testing suites, maybe something like ChaosNet from ApeWorks

#### Idea 2: POS system that accepts multiple payments

#### Idea 3: Course platform that has embedded terminals and code editors that run in a vm (using Flame)

#### Idea 4: Superchileanapp
Basic Features:
- Scrape Fintual, Racional, Buda, Banks to get financial products and display on the page as portfolio
- You could also scrape public services to see different things, such as Public Transport cards balance (not sure if you can query all the time this API), stuff related to taxes 
- Maybe add a neatpagos scrape also
- connect your bank account to see your finances

#### Idea 5: Onchain SVGs
Sub-ideas:
- Sub-idea 1: This Cursed Machine badge, that gets stamped if you've completed different level of difficulties in orders
- Sub-idea 2: A primodium nft that shows your total attack power from all your fleets, how many asteroids and fleets you control, and a different title based on how far have you progressed on the game
- Sub-idea 3: Ducks building a super Duck NFT, that will evolve if you do certain stuff, until eventually becomes a super built duck?

#### Idea 6: Bills App (kinda like onchain cheques)
This could be also a dynamic nft, that builds like a dollar bill wth your avatar in the middle, the color of the token and amount, or maybe a cheque that varies with onchain data, and you can send it to people to claim the amount of the nft. 
- Build Onchain SVGs for a QR code to share money and the code to claim it is stored in the qr code
- PWA and use social login + smart accounts (to sponsor gas for users)
- Cashout using an off-ramp or whatever
