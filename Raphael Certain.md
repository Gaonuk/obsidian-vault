### Background
- I come from a same technical background, wanted to build a startup
- Started a company while in Master's degree
- Friends were pushing him to do the X-HEC program
- He didn't want to do more studying
- For him it was more of a transition year, as he was building a startup as a student

### Program
- It's very oriented to build a company
- He did it with his desire to go to the USA with the Berkeley exchange
- He was looking for co-founders, it's a very good way to find people
- The relationships are the most valuable things of the program
- It's more about the experience
- They like people who are building, iterate and really want to build things
- They want people who have not just a business understanding of entrepreneurship, they want technical people also
- They want to help connect people together
#### Learn Phase
- Understanding about startups, work with someone who's building a startup
- Restructuring mission: propose a take-over plan, learn about bankruptcy filings, etc..
- Most classes in Paris
- Living in Paris

#### Test Phase
- From January start building your own project
- Just go to Berkeley bro
- Super valuable: you make awesome connections
- Show your motivation, dedication, reasons to go
- I don't think they have refused anyone to go to Berkeley
- They have help for paying the Berkeley Fees
- 10k euros for 3 months for the Learn2Launch + whatever you need to live

#### Launch Phase
- After going back you should start working on your thesis
- Most of the people who are working on good projects are too busy to do their thesis
- 70 pages about a specific topic
- It can be a scientific paper.
- Not a big deal, he did it two weeks before the deadline

### Internationality
- There were 20 international out of the 120 students, he said that it's been going down for the newer cohorts with more French and less internationals
- He thinks the french requirement isn't the main driver, but if they have 1 spot and two candidates with the same entrepreneurship background and one is french, probably they will select him

### Interview
- He said that they are looking for students who are in M1 (first year masters) or have already done a Master's degree
- If you haven't done a Master's they will ask you about that and why you didn't in the interview so point towards your professional experience that makes up for your lack of Master's
- They want someone who's really interested in the program, that's why they ask if you've talked to alumni, if you know the whole curriculum and things you're going to. And not someone who's just throwing application after application to a bunch of programs

### Entrepreneurship Essay
- In regards to the question about the type of entrepreneurship he thinks it's more related to you as a person, there's no right answer. He thinks answers can be like: "I want to raise 10M usd and build for 5 years" or "I will bootstrap, build an MVP see if there is PMF and then after being able to sell the product or service look towards doing a fundraise"
- In general, he thinks the bootstrap answer is a better one, keep in mind industry constraints and best practices
